      "content": "In 2024, the healthcare industry explored different use cases for AI to improve care, streamline administrative workflows and increase efficiency. Now that the dust is beginning to settle, healthcare organizations are focused on getting real value from AI in 2025. While the AI hype persists, administrators are now more focused on securing a clear return on investment (ROI). They are prioritizing technologies that deliver immediate benefits and holding off on those that aren’t fully developed. As the managing director and founder of IT Medical, I’ve seen how AI can transform healthcare by enhancing patient outcomes and streamlining clinical workflows. My work in health tech has fueled my passion for using AI to solve real-world challenges. In this article, I’ll explore five key areas that I believe will become increasingly important in 2025 as organizations adopt AI to achieve meaningful value. 1. AI-Driven Genomics For Precision Medicine AI has revolutionized genomic medicine, paving the way for rapid advancements in precision medicine, a key focus for the future. Cancer is recognized as a disease of the genome. However, our inability to effectively manage and analyze large volumes of genomic data has slowed progress across research and clinical applications. AI-driven genomics promises rapid improvements in cancer care by overcoming these challenges. For instance, a 2024 paper leveraged AI to analyze large genomics and other omics datasets to predict survival outcomes for patients with pancreatic cancer. This demonstrated AI’s ability to generate actionable insights from large volumes of diverse data. Another paper from 2024 used machine learning to identify complex genomic variants associated with psychiatric disorders from standard genomics datasets. These studies deepen our understanding of individual disease risks and support personalized treatment and prevention strategies. 2. Next-Generation Medical Imaging A cornerstone of diagnostics for cancer and other diseases, medical imaging has already benefited enormously from AI-driven processes, and 2025 promises further achievements. A study published in January 2025 demonstrated AI’s real-world, large-scale implementation in medical imaging and its benefits to patient care. The research involved the optional AI-assisted mammography screening of 260,739 women from 463,094 patients. With AI support, radiologists increased breast cancer detection by 17.6% and lowered recall rates. Additionally, the AI group had a higher positive predictive value for recalls than the control group. GE Healthcare’s Roland Rott predicts that “2025 will showcase many more examples of AI’s ability to improve the lives of cancer patients and the care offered by their providers.” AI not only benefits diagnostic accuracy and supports clinical decision making but also enables faster radiology workflows and reduced costs. 3. Generative AI For Clinical Documentation And Support Technological developments like electronic health records (EHR) have improved clinical workflows but have led to problems like clinician burnout and documentation burdens. In 2025, AI promises to help reduce these burdens by providing more accurate and comprehensive support during clinical documentation procedures. AI-powered scribes can lead to a 170% increase in recording speed compared to in-person scribes, and the use of AI for documentation removes the need for manual documentation by clinicians, representing a potential 90% reduction in time spent on administrative tasks. In a study of more than 100,000 virtual healthcare encounters, clinicians assessed AI-conducted patient interviews and diagnoses. Upon review, they agreed with the AI-generated diagnoses in 84.2% of cases and the top-ranked diagnoses in 60.9% of cases. These results demonstrate AI’s effectiveness in supporting clinical diagnosis in addition to routine documentation tasks. 4. Integration of AI And IoMT The Internet of Medical Things (IoMT) is an interconnected system of medical devices and other technologies that track health parameters and monitor patients. First mentioned in 1999, the IoMT has grown to an estimated market value of 97.7% billion in 2025. The IoMT enables patients to take tests at home, receive reminders to take medicine and allows for real-time monitoring. Wearable technologies are a central pillar of the IoMT, allowing health parameters to be recorded and shared with high accuracy. The data collected by these devices includes but is not limited to blood glucose levels, electrocardiogram readings, skin temperature and respiration rates. This makes them indispensable for tracking chronic diseases such as diabetes and predicting acute health events. For instance, a randomized controlled trial found that daily remote monitoring of cardiovascular parameters and integrating these data within neural network modeling significantly improved risk stratification and appropriate implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD) treatments. Another randomized controlled trial found continuous glucose monitoring resulted in a statistically significant reduction in hypoglycemia. 5. AI-Driven Remote Patient Monitoring An essential role of AI lies in remote patient engagement and monitoring. AI-powered assistants mean patients don’t need to rely on non-personalized online information. Instead, they can query symptoms against a personalized system that accounts for their medical history, including recent real-time data. A study found that 90% of patients using AI assistants reported receiving useful information for their health problems and perceived it as a helpful diagnostic tool. A paper from January 2025 established a model called CRAFT-MD for testing the applicability of AI models for patient engagement, medical history tracking and questioning, highlighting areas for improvement as these tools become more widespread within healthcare. Ultimately, AI-driven remote patient engagement is poised to significantly enhance personalized healthcare and improve patient outcomes as its applications expand. Conclusion In 2025, AI innovations look set to transform healthcare by facilitating precision medicine, improving diagnostic accuracy, enhancing patient experience and streamlining clinical workflows. Early adopters who leverage AI-driven genomics, next-generation imaging, advanced clinical documentation and integrated IoMT systems are poised to achieve significant ROI and better patient outcomes in 2025. To adopt AI successfully, focus on areas where it delivers immediate value, like enhancing diagnostics or reducing administrative tasks. Ensure smooth integration with existing systems, invest in staff training to boost AI literacy and choose a provider with proven healthcare AI expertise for reliable, long-term support. As more healthcare providers embrace these transformative AI solutions, the industry stands on the brink of a new era marked by efficiency, innovation and improved health."

      "title": "10 AI Healthcare Trends to Watch in 2025 and Beyond",
      "content": "AI is redefining the healthcare sector, with hospitals, health systems and large medical practices incorporating AI technologies into clinical and administrative workflows. Here’s a look at some of the AI trends expected to reshape healthcare in the years ahead. 1. Chatbots connecting with patients As with many other industries, healthcare has embraced AI-powered chatbots to complement customer service. Based on how a patient answers a chatbot’s intake questions, the chatbot can determine whether an automated system can handle an inquiry -- such as scheduling an appointment, refilling a prescription or paying a bill -- or whether a patient needs to speak to a person based on their medical symptoms or the complexity of their needs. In addition, chatbots can augment patient engagement efforts by providing evidence-based recommendations or translating educational resources to a patient’s native language. 2. Boosting clinician productivity Across the industry, survey data from Rock Health showed more than 30% of primary care physicians use AI for clerical support, such as documenting patient visits and drafting post-visit notes to patients. Close to 25% said they use AI for information management and clinical decision support. Critically, less than 10% of primary care physicians said they don’t want to use AI at work. The Cleveland Clinic is one health system that has deployed AI in the exam room, with chatbots embedded in the EHR system to help retrieve information and ambient listening technology capturing notes and creating instructions for prescriptions or lab orders. 3. Sorting through data Roughly 80% of healthcare data is unstructured, meaning it doesn’t easily fit into database rows and columns. AI systems can parse unstructured data sources, such as medical images and lab reports, far more quickly than traditional analytics tools. Depending on the algorithm being used, models can provide insight into a potential diagnosis, identify high-risk patients or offer treatment recommendations. AI-powered data analysis can also help hospitals prevent adverse events, such as harmful drug interactions or sepsis infections. 4. Detecting anomalies in imaging Imaging studies drive diagnostic and treatment decisions. However, analysis with the naked eye can be time-consuming and prone to error -- and backlogs are all too common. Image recognition tools can interpret studies such as X-rays, electrocardiograms and CAT scans to identify irregularities and suggest a potential diagnosis. AI systems can also clear studies with normal results so radiologists and other members of the care team can focus on studies that need careful review. 5. Robots assisting with surgery Robot-assisted surgery debuted in the 1980s and, after initial trepidation among surgeons, the technology began to take off in the 2000s. The American College of Surgeons (ACS) has noted increased interest in robot-assisted surgery for procedures involving tight, cramped and sometimes inaccessible areas, particularly the prostate and urinary tract. The main benefit is a minimally invasive approach that contributes to shorter hospital stays and faster recovery times. Advances in automation should soon let robotic systems execute minor tasks such as sutures, ACS indicated. 6. Augmenting physical therapy Practice guidelines in physical therapy tend to be based on small studies, as it can be difficult to enroll patients at a single site with the same diagnosis and treatment plan. AI can analyze real-world data from PT patients in many settings; the output of this analysis can provide personalized recommendations for individual patients and inform guidelines for specific populations in need of PT services. Meanwhile, incorporating virtual reality into PT treatment can provide immediate feedback to patients about whether a movement is being done properly and to clinicians about how a patient is responding. 7. Supplementing exercise plans Whether created from queries to generative AI models or fitness apps gathering data from wearables, personalized exercise programs are poised to help address patients’ specific wellness needs and fitness goals. A recent literature review noted individuals participating in various strength, stretching and resistance training programs showed measurable improvement compared to the control group. As with many AI use cases, though, the expert recommendation is to use AI as a supplemental tool for exercise programs but 'not as a substitute for personalized, progressive, and health condition-specific prescriptions provided by healthcare and fitness professionals.' 8. Streamlining the revenue cycle Automating various stages of claims processing -- for instance, applying the right medical codes to a patient visit or filling in demographic information -- means 'claims can go out the door with no human touch on the back end,' Archer said. For example, Tryon Medical Partners now files about 90% of prior authorization requests automatically, and denial rates are below 2%. Before automation, the process was highly manual, leading to long wait times on the phone -- not to mention mounting frustration from patients. 'This allows us to manage our labor in a more effective way,' he said. 9. Strengthening the supply chain Managing the inventory of vaccines, medications and other supplies with cold storage requirements or expiration dates can be a delicate balancing act. Keep too many items in stock and some can go bad, costing the facility money; keep too few and supplies will run out, negatively impacting patient outcomes. Predictive analytics supplements inventory management by tracking historical data and considering external factors to help anticipate demand and avoid waste. Leaders can also see which suppliers have been most reliable in meeting shipping deadlines as well as product safety requirements. 10. Optimizing business strategy In competitive markets, hospitals and health systems need all the help they can get to reach more patients in their catchment area or identify service lines ripe for expansion. Bringing AI into sales and marketing helps organizations better understand market dynamics, such as referral patterns and specific medical needs within the population. This information can help influence business decisions that drive revenue growth."
